# pychain
Demonstrate the logic of blockchain and smart contracts using Python (as simple and intuitive as possible)

The provided code can be used to conceptualize how smart contracts work before you jump in to learn 
Etherium Virtual Machine (EVM), Solidity, contract testing and deployment (HardHat, Truffle, Brownie, ether.js, etc).

These excercises are good if you already know Python and want to study the logic of blockchain and 
how smart contracts work. If you use a familar programming language chances are you likely 
and progress fast in your learning and then transfer you skills to real web3 using Solidity.

Notebooks and code to follow:

1. how blockchain works (two notebooks)
2. how smart contracts work ([escrow2.ipynb](escrow2.ipynb))

I intend to supply self-check questionnaires and excercises to these notbooks.
